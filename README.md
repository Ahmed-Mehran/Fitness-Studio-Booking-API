# Fitness-Studio-Booking-API
This is a Django REST Framework-based API for a fictional fitness studio. It allows users to view available fitness class sessions (like Yoga, Zumba, HIIT) and book slots. The system prevents overbooking and duplicate bookings by email while managing available slots. Sessions are added securely through the Django admin panel.
